# ANN-from-scratch
The original dataset is in the LBW_Dataset.csv file. After pre-processing the file using the mean_mode_cleaned.py file, the mean_mode_cleaned.csv file is obtained. Using this file, the ANN from scratch is run in the ANN-complete.py file. This file can be run directly, provided that it and mean_mode_cleaned.csv are present in the same directory. An accuracy of 82% is obtained.
